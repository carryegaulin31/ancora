    "trial_summary": "REMAP-CAP is a randomised, embedded, multifactorial, adaptive platform trial for\n      community-acquired pneumonia.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a range of interventions to improve\n      outcome of patients admitted to intensive care with community-acquired pneumonia.\n\n      In addition, REMAP-CAP provides and adaptive research platform for evaluation of multiple\n      treatment modalities in the event of a respiratory pandemic resulting in critical illness.\n\n      REMAP-COVID is a sub-platform of REMAP-CAP that evaluates treatments specific to COVID-19.",
    "trial_description": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) that is of sufficient severity to require admission to an\n      intensive care unit (ICU) is associated with substantial mortality.\n\n      Patients with pneumonia who are being treated in an ICU will receive therapy that consists of\n      many different treatments, as many as 20 or 30. These treatments act together to treat both\n      the infection and its effects on the body. When treating a patient, doctors choose from many\n      different treatments, most of which are known or believed to be safe and effective. However,\n      doctors don't always know which treatment option is the better one, as individuals or groups\n      of individuals may respond differently. This study aims to help doctors understand which\n      treatments work best.\n\n      This clinical study has been designed in a way that allows the information from patients\n      already in the study to help new patients joining the study. Most studies aren't able to do\n      that. REMAP-CAP has been designed to:\n\n        -  Evaluate multiple treatment strategies, at the same time, in the same patient.\n\n        -  Reach platform conclusions when sufficient data is accrued, rather than when a\n           pre-specified sample size is reached\n\n        -  Utilise data that is already accrued to increase the likelihood that patients within the\n           trial are randomised to treatments that are more likely to be beneficial\n\n        -  New questions can be substituted into the trial as initial questions are answered,\n           meaning that the trial can be perpetual or open-ended\n\n        -  Interactions between interventions in different domains can be evaluated\n\n      It is reasonable to presume that any pandemic respiratory infection of major significance to\n      public health will manifest as life-threatening respiratory infection including Severe Acute\n      Respiratory illness and severe Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) with concomitant admission\n      to hospital, and for some patients, admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Previous\n      pandemics and more localized outbreaks of respiratory emerging infections have resulted in\n      severe CAP and ICU admission.\n\n      Previous pandemics and outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases have outlined the urgent\n      need for evidence, preferably from Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), to guide best\n      treatment. However, there are substantial challenges associated with being able to organize\n      such trials when the time of onset of a pandemic and its exact nature are unpredictable. As\n      an adaptive platform trial that enrolls patients during the interpandemic period, REMAP-CAP\n      is ideally positioned to adapt, in the event of a respiratory pandemic, to evaluate existing\n      treatments as well as novel approaches.",

    "trial_summary": "In the current situation it is of great importance to discover a safe, cost-effective and\n      available treatment strategy in order to limit the rapidly spreading SARS-Cov-2. Recent\n      studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine could have a role in the treatment of infected\n      patients. It is however not very likely that hydroxychloroquine alone could be adequate for\n      treatment of Covid-19 disease. Effective therapy that prevents the virus entrance should\n      contain at least TMPRSS2 inhibitor or a competitive inhibitor of viral ACE 2 binding. The use\n      of bromhexine at the dose adequate to selectively inhibit the TMPRSS2, resulting in\n      preventing of viral entrance via TMPRSS2-specific pathway, coud be an effective treatment of\n      Covid-19. In our study we would like to explore the therapeutic potential of bromhexin and\n      hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients.\n\n      Hypothesis\n\n        1. Combined treatment with bromhexin and hydroxychloroquine shortens the course of disease\n           in hospitalized Covid-19 patients compared to hydroxychloroquine alone.\n\n        2. Combined treatment with bromhexin and hydroxychloroquine lowers the incidence of\n           secundary pulmonary infections in hospitalized Covid-19 patients compared to\n           hydroxychloroquine alone.\n\n        3.

The questionnaire is used to assess the cardiovascular risk (contains\n      medication, past medical history).\n\n      Non-study-related measures (standardised routine analyses in an intensive care unit)\n\n      To determine the cardiovascular risk:\n\n      See Patient Questionnaire, Lipid Status, HbA1c\n\n      For follow-up (daily routine laboratory checks):\n\n      Blood count, coagulation, liver and kidney counts, triglycerides, biomarkers (CK, CK-MB,\n      TropT, NTproBNP, CRP, PCT, IL-6, D-dimer, LDH, myoglobin).\n\n      Other parameters and therapies that are considered in the evaluation or that are used to\n      create the data set:\n\n      Fluid introduction, fluid discharge, balance, prone positioning, non-invasive ventilation\n      (PEEP, fiO2), invasive ventilation (ventilation mode, PEEP, Pinsp, fiO2, AF), respiration\n      (respiratory rate, fiO2, SpO2, paO2, pCO2, etCO2), circulation parameters (RR syst, RR dia,\n      MAP, HF, ECG (rhythm, Qtc)), extracorporeal organ support procedures, mortality, med.\n      complications, entire drug therapy (e.g: norepinephrine (incl. dose), levosimendan (incl.\n      dose), vasopressin (incl. dose), cortisone (incl. dose), dobutamine (incl. dose), supportive\n      therapy (zinc, vitamin C, selenium), antifungal and antibiotic therapy, hydroxychloroquine,\n      lopinavir, remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab.\n\n      Anonymisation of patients\n\n      After enrolment in the study, the patient data is encoded/pseudo-anonymised, i.e. patients\n      are identified with a consecutive ID number (neither name, initials nor laboratory\n      requirement number are recorded). To find out the previous illnesses of intensive care\n      patients it is necessary to create a list of patient names and the corresponding ID numbers\n      for pseudonymisation. This list remains with the investigator.\n\n      Use of clinical data For the statistical analysis, clinical data in pseudo-anonymised/encoded\n      form are used, e.g. diagnosis, concomitant diseases, long-term medication, intensive care\n      therapy, medication, smoking, age, sex.\n\n      Should further questions arise during the study regarding this patient collective, the\n      collected data would be used for further evaluations.\n\n      Centre/intensive care units The test centre is the LKH Univ.Klinikum Graz, Auenbruggerplatz\n      5, A-8036 Graz. Patients are admitted to the SARS - CoV-2 (COVID-19) isolation unit intensive\n      care units of the LKH University Hospital Graz.",

    "trial_summary": "The aim of this study is to measure current affective symptoms and psychological distress in\n      individuals with severe mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic using an online\n      questionnaire survey. In addition, this study aims at identifying individual beliefs, sleep\n      quality, attitudes concerning the virus, the adherence to the measures, believing processes,\n      and coping strategies/resilience patterns referring to COVID-19 in different study centers.",
    "trial_description": "A novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of\n      respiratory illness (corona virus disease COVID-19) all over the world. The COVID-19 pandemic\n      is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to psychological\n      resilience.\n\n      Studies reviewed the psychological impact of quarantine and reported negative psychological\n      effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger, infection fears,\n      frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and\n      stigma. A loss of daily structure and reduced social contacts were associated with\n      frustration, boredom, reduced psychological-well being and psychological distress.\n\n      A recently conducted online questionnaire survey, investigating emotional responses and\n      coping strategies of nurses, found sex differences in anxiety and fear referred to COVID-19\n      (women showed more severe anxiety and fear than men) and differences between participants\n      from cities showing more anxiety and fear compared with participants from rural showing more\n      sadness. The closer COVID-19 was to the participants, the stronger the anxiety and anger.\n\n      All these investigated psychological variables (i.e. anxiety, depression, boredom, loss of\n      daily structure) have been found to impact the course and outcome of psychiatric disorders.\n      Nowadays, COVID-19 is a pressure source with great influence, both for individuals and for\n      the social public groups. Different individuals and groups may experience different levels of\n      psychological crisis and patients with psychiatric disorders may experience more or less\n      psychological symptoms than healthy control persons. According to a recent study, lithium,\n      widely used to treat bipolar disorder, has been shown to exhibit antiviral activity and\n      appears as a possible candidate for therapy of COVID-19. However, more research data are\n      needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and\n      psychiatric symptoms during the pandemic.\n\n      Scientific questions\n\n        1. How do psychiatric patients experience the COVID-19 outbreak including quarantine and\n           are there associations with affective symptoms and psychological distress? Is there a\n           change in symptomatology during time? Are there differences to healthy controls, and\n           between individuals with different diagnosis?\n\n        2. Is there a difference between psychiatric patients and healthy controls in regard to\n           emotional response, cognition and behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine?\n           Is there a difference between different psychiatric diagnosis groups?\n\n        3. Is there an association between consequences of social distance on lifestyle factors\n           (nutrition, sleep quality, physical activity, substance abuse) and are there\n           associations with psychological well-being/psychological symptoms in individuals with\n           psychiatric disorder and controls? Is there a difference between different psychiatric\n           diagnosis groups and healthy controls?\n\n        4. What do individuals with psychiatric disorders think about the COVID-19 related measures\n           und quarantine regulations and how is the adherence to the measures? Are there\n           associations between adherence and attitude towards COVID-19 measures? Is there a\n           difference between patients and healthy controls? Is there a difference between\n           different psychiatric diagnosis groups?\n\n        5. Are there sex and age differences in the investigated variables? (emotional response to\n           COVID-19 outbreak, attitude towards measures, adherence)?\n\n        6. Is there a relationship between an infection with SARS-CoV-2 and disease course in\n           psychiatric disorder? Is there a difference between different psychiatric diagnosis\n           groups and healthy controls? Which role plays lithium treatment (prescribed beyond the\n           study) in this context? The investigators hypothesize, loss of daily structure, reduced\n           social contacts, loneliness, reduced psychiatric care, and other possible lifestyle\n           changes due to the quarantine and social distancing measures, have a negative effect on\n           psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, somatisation, sleep quality) in individuals\n           with psychiatric disorder compared to healthy controls. In contrast, resilience and\n           positive cognition processes might be positively correlated to psychological well-being.",

    "trial_description": "The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected disease (COVID-19) began in\n      Wuhan, Hubei province in December 2019, spread throughout China in early 2020 and developed\n      as a pandemic thereafter. Although the virus mainly causes respiratory symptoms, GI\n      presentations have been reported in and outside of China. Patients may present with anorexia,\n      nausea, vomiting and abdominal discomfort. Also, faecal-oral transmission of the virus is\n      currently discussed. Preliminary, unpublished data from China suggest that patients with GI\n      symptoms may suffer more frequently from severe courses of the disease. Furthermore, liver\n      injury has been observed during COVID-19 disease.\n\n      It is currently unclear, whether patients with chronic liver diseases are at a higher risk to\n      contract COVID-19, to develop a more severe disease course or exhibit higher mortality.\n      Preliminary unpublished communications report conflicting data on COVID-19 in patients with\n      chronic liver diseases. According to those reports, it seems that immunosuppressed\n      individuals (e.g. stable patients after liver transplantation or patients with autoimmune\n      liver disease) do not suffer from more severe pulmonary disease when infected with SARS-CoV-2\n      compared to non-immunosuppressed individuals. To understand the impact of Covid-19 disease on\n      patients with liver diseases, two registries have been launched to collect anonymous data\n      (SECURE-cirrhosis and COVID-Hep.net). As by 1st of April 24 cases with 4 fatalities have been\n      reported, however, this system does not provide enough information to understand the risk of\n      patients in more detail, since it is unknown if all patients are reported and how many\n      patients were at risk. Furthermore, the available data are very superficial.\n\n      Besides the direct effects of COVID-19, patients with chronic liver diseases might also be\n      vulnerable to the indirect effects of the pandemic. Quarantine measures may have considerable\n      psychological impact and may cause post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger.\n      There is no available data on the impact of quarantine on risk behaviour, such as alcohol\n      consumption or the use of other liver toxic substances. Such behaviour - although destructive\n      for everyone - can increase the risk of decompensation in patients with liver cirrhosis and\n      cause potentially lethal complications which might require intensive care. Furthermore, the\n      difficulty of access to care for patients with chronic diseases may impact negatively on the\n      course of chronic diseases. To date, it is unclear whether the restricted social life and the\n      restrictions in access to care during the pandemic impacts on liver-related morbidity and\n      mortality.\n\n      Another possibility of how studying patients with liver diseases can benefit the general\n      population, is to analyse their medications. Patients with chronic liver disease receive a\n      specialised set of drugs, some of which might be effective against SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately,\n      the first emergency trial using ritonavir/Lopinavir - antiviral substances that are used to\n      treat HIV and HIV/Hepatitis B or C coinfections - showed disappointing results against\n      SARS-CoV-2. However, other antiviral drugs, for example against hepatitis C, could\n      theoretically also be beneficial. It is currently unknown if patients who take drugs against\n      viral hepatitis may be protected against COVID-19 and a retrospective risk assessment might\n      contribute to more informed studies and a more rational distribution of resources.",

Although the virus mainly causes respiratory symptoms, GI\n      (gastrointestinal) presentations have been reported in and outside of China. Patients may\n      present with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. Also, faecal-oral\n      transmission of the virus is currently discussed. Preliminary, unpublished data from China\n      suggest that patients with GI symptoms may suffer more frequently from severe courses of the\n      disease. Clinical studies show an incidence rate of diarrhea ranging from 2% to 50% of cases.\n      It may precede or trail respiratory symptoms. A pooled analysis revealed an overall\n      percentage of diarrhea onset of 10.4%. SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2\n      (ACE2) for cellular entry. ACE2 is expressed in the small intestinal epithelia as well as in\n      the upper esophagus, liver, and colon. SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity to ACE2 is significantly\n      higher (10-20 times) compared with SARS-CoV. Diarrhea is associated with prolonged symptoms\n      and viral carriage.\n\n      Clinical information on the characteristics of Covid-19 diarrhea is scarce. The duration of\n      diarrhea is around 4 days with 3-4 loose stools per day. Faecal calprotectin is elevated in\n      stool of patients with Covid-19 diarrhea.\n\n      So far, no therapy is available for Covid-19 infection in general or for Covid-19 induced\n      diarrhea. Rehydration and potassium monitoring should be performed as in all patients with\n      diarrhea. It is important to underline that antivirals and antibiotics are often used for\n      COVID-19 treatment or treatment of bacterial superinfections, involving a likely alteration\n      of the gut microbiota and causing diarrhea. It is therefore plausible that the gut microbiota\n      could be a new therapeutic target and that probiotics or synbiotics (combination of\n      probiotics with prebiotics) could have a role in the management of these patients. The\n      China's National Health Commission recommended the use of probiotics for the treatment of\n      patients with severe COVID-19 in order to preserve intestinal balance and to prevent\n      secondary bacterial infections without any available clinical studies to support this and\n      probiotics apparently were used in Zhejiang during the Covid-19 pandemic. Although there is\n      no specific data on the effects of probiotics on SARS-CoV2 infections, meta-analyses show\n      that probiotics are effective in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections and\n      viral gastroenteritis of other origins. Furthermore, Enterococcus faecium has been shown to\n      have antiviral effects in enteropathogenic coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus\n      infections in piglets. We therefore aim to assess the role of synbiotics in the therapy of\n      Covid-19 infection with gastrointestinal symptoms.",

Considering the high global prevalence of CVD and its risk factors (e.g.\n      hypertension and diabetes) and the suggested link with COVID19 it is urgent to initiate more\n      robust studies to clarify the many issues early reports have engendered.

All patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID) and history or active\n      hematological malignancies, who refer to any Hematological Unit will be included.",
    "trial_description": "This is a retrospective/prospective, cohort, non-interventional observational study. An\n      informed consensus for the participation is available. In this section we provide\n      informations on sample size and statistical analysis.\n\n      In Italy, the projected estimate of complete HM prevalence at Jan 1, 2020 has been\n      established as 48,254 cases for Hodgkin lymphoma, 110.715 cases for non Hodgkin Lymphomas,\n      67,301 for leukemias, and 25,066 for multiple myeloma (Guzzinati et al, BMC Cancer 2018). The\n      Italian Dipartimento della Protezione Civile website reported (March 23, 2020) that 63,927\n      cases are currently infected with SARS-CoV-2. No formal sample size calculation was made for\n      this project but, on the basis of data available to date, considering the prevalence of\n      hematological patients in Italy (0.4%) and assuming that these patients have the same risk of\n      contracting COVID-19 as the general population, we supposed to enroll at least 250 patients\n      (at March 24, 2020).\n\n      Statistical analyses All data collected will be summarized using appropriate descriptive\n      statistics: absolute and relative frequencies for discrete variables; mean, standard\n      deviation, median and interquartile range for continuous ones. To identify factors\n      significantly associated with composite endpoint, log-binomial regression will be used for\n      modelling risk ratio together with 95% confidence interval estimated.\n\n      The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method will be applied for\n      selecting the factors able to independently predict primary end-point. LASSO selects\n      variables correlates to the measured outcome by shrinking coefficients weights, down to zero\n      for the ones not correlated to outcome. In addition, machine learning techniques will be used\n      for validating results from LASSO. A weight will be assigned to each coefficient of the\n      selected predictors and weights will be summed to produce a total aggregate score. Predictive\n      performance will be assessed through discrimination and calibration. Discrimination indicates\n      how well the model can distinguish individuals with the outcome from those without the\n      outcome. Two, the net reclassification improvement (NRI) will be calculated for assessing the\n      'net' number of individuals correctly reclassified using \"the new model\" over a comparator\n      index [i.e., CCI (Charlson Comorbidity Score) or MCS (Multisource Comorbidity Score), or\n      HM-disease specific]. Calibration ascertains the concordance between the model's predictions\n      and observed outcomes, which we evaluated using a calibration plot. Cartographic and\n      geostatistical methods will be used to exploring the spatial patterns of disease. An\n      Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) and the Kriging method will be also applied to\n      describe and model spatial (geographical) pattern.",

Participants will go through phone questioning\n      and recommendation in 5 fields: (1) mental health (2) smoking habits, (3) physical activity,\n      (4) dietary habits, (5) alcohol consumption. Both groups A and B will receive the same line\n      of questioning to assess habits concerning these topics. In Group A: questioning will be done\n      in sequence followed by a shared minimal intervention aimed towards improvement of these\n      factors but without any personalized recommendation. In Group B: each assessment will be\n      followed by specific and personalized recommendations. Assessment will be done weekly during\n      the first month, every second week in the second month, then monthly. Considering one interim\n      analysis for efficacy the estimated sample size is 3788 (rounded up to 3800) subject per\n      study arm.

    "trial_summary": "In the last 10 years, severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) was responsible of multiple\n      outbreaks putting a strain on the public health worldwide. Indeed, SARI had a relevant role\n      in the development of pandemic and epidemic with terrible consequences such as the 2009 H1N1\n      pandemic which led to more than 200.000 respiratory deaths globally.\n\n      In late December 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei, China, a new respiratory syndrome emerged with\n      clinical signs of viral pneumonia and person-to-person transmission. Tests showed the\n      appearance of a novel coronavirus, namely the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Two other\n      strains, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East\n      respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have caused severe respiratory illnesses,\n      sometimes fatal. In particular, the mortality rate associated with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, was\n      of 10% and 37% respectively.\n\n      Even though COVID-19 appeared from the first time in China, quickly it spread worldwide and\n      cases have been described in other countries such as Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Germany,\n      Italy, France, Iran, USA and many other countries. An early paper reported 41 patients with\n      laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection in Wuhan. The median age of the patients was 49 years\n      and mostly men (73%). Among those, 32% were admitted to the ICU because of the severe\n      hypoxemia. The most associated comorbidities were diabetes (20%), hypertension (15%), and\n      cardiovascular diseases (15%). On admission, 98% of the patients had bilateral multiple\n      lobular and sub-segmental areas of consolidation. Importantly, acute respiratory distress\n      syndrome (ARDS) developed in 29% of the patients, while acute cardiac injury in 12%, and\n      secondary infection in 10%. Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 10% of those\n      patients, and two of these patients (5%) had refractory hypoxemia and received extracorporeal\n      membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In a later retrospective report by Wang and collaborators,\n      clinical characteristics of 138 patients with COVID-19 infection were described. ICU\n      admission was required in 26.1% of the patients for acute respiratory distress syndrome\n      (61.1%), arrhythmia (44.4%), and shock (30.6%). ECMO support was needed in 11% of the\n      patients admitted to the ICU. During the period of follow-up, overall mortality was 4.3%.\n\n      The use of ECMO in COVID-19 infection is increasing due to the high transmission rate of the\n      infection and the respiratory-related mortality.\n\n      Therefore, the investigators believe that ECMO in case of severe interstitial pneumonia\n      caused by COVID could represent a valid solution in order to avoid lung injuries related to\n      prolonged treatment with non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation. In addition, ECMO\n      could have a role for the systemic complications such as septic and cardiogenic shock as well\n      myocarditis scenarios. Potential clinical effects and outcomes of the ECMO support in the\n      novel coronavirus pandemic will be recorded and analyzed in our project.\n\n      The researchers hypothesize that a significant percentage of patients with COVID-19 infection\n      will require the utilize of ECMO for refactory hypoxemia, cardiogenic shock or septic shock.\n      This study seeks to prove this hypothesis by conducting an observational\n      retrospective/prospective study of patients in the ICU who underwent ECMO support and\n      describe clinical features, severity of pulmonary dysfunction and risk factors of\n      COVID-patients who need ECMO support, the incidence of ECMO use, ECMO technical\n      characteristics, duration of ECMO, complications and outcomes of COVID-patients requiring\n      ECMO support.",

The emerging outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute\n      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread worldwide.

Multicentric, randomized study.\n\n      Participants. Clinical presentations are based upon clinical phenotypes identified by the\n      Italian Society of Emergency and Urgency Medicine (SIMEU - Societ\u00e0 Italiana di Medicina di\n      Emergenza-Urgenza) and patients that meet criteria of phenotypes 2 to 4 were treat with best\n      available therapy (BAT), and randomized to receive or not O3-autohemotherapy.\n\n      Main outcome measures.

These patients need to be hospitalized because they can get quickly worse.\n\n        -  Phenotype 3: subjects with fever associate to moderate-severe respiratory insufficiency\n           (at triage PO2< 60 mmHg in ambient air) and /or bilateral pulmonary consolidation area\n           at Chest XR. These patients need to be treated with high flow oxygen therapy.\n\n        -  Phenotype 4: subjects with respiratory failure with suspected ARDS (Adult Respiratory\n           Distress Syndrome) or complicated pneumonia. These patients require hospitalization in\n           sub-intensive care unit.\n\n        -  Phenotype 5: subject with ARDS at the beginning.

    "trial_description": "One of the first scientific papers published on the COVID-19 epidemic in China showed that\n      patients still asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic, positive for SARS-CoV-2 on the RT-PCR test,\n      presented chest CT images referring to parenchymal infiltrate with a prevalent appearance at\n      ground-glass compatible with initial COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n      An ongoing study anticipates that the sensitivity of chest CT is higher than that of the\n      RT-PCR molecular test for SARS-CoV-2 (performed on the pharyngeal swab or sputum) (50 out of\n      51, 98%, 95% CI: 90% -100% vs 36 out of 51, 71%, IC95%: 56% -83%) in the early diagnosis of\n      COVID-19.\n\n      Recent work seems to shows that Lung Ultrasound is effective in the clinical evaluation and\n      diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n      In a previous study, in addition, sensitivity and specificity of the Lung Ultrasound in the\n      early diagnosis of H1N1 flu pneumonia was 94.1% (32 out of 34) and 84.8% respectively (28 out\n      of 33), with a positive predictive value of 86.5% (32 out of 37) and a negative predictive\n      value of 93.3% (28 out of 30).\n\n      The concordance between the lung ultrasound findings and the lung lesions found on CT has\n      recently been demonstrated (\"lobe-specific\" concordance equal to 87%; \"lung-specific\n      concordance\" equal to 92.5 % for the right lung and 83.6% for the left lung).\n\n      These data suggest to better explore the diagnostic accuracy of the Lung Ultrasound in\n      SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "trial_description": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), is a highly\n      contagious disease that appeared in Wuhan, Hubei province of China in December 2019. It has\n      now spread to multiple countries through infected persons travelling mainly by air. Most of\n      the infected patients have mild symptoms including fever, fatigue and cough. But in severe\n      cases, patients can progress rapidly and develop the acute respiratory distress syndrome,\n      septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy including a disseminated intravascular\n      coagulation (DIC).\n\n      Multiple myeloma (MM) is a mature B-cell malignancy largely affecting the older patient with\n      a median age at presentation of 70 years. The general performance status (PS) and the\n      presence of comorbidity can identify a group of patients with poor tolerance to treatment, as\n      well as risks of both bacterial and viral infection. MM patients have benefited significantly\n      from therapeutic developments, however, the host response biology of the older person,\n      coupled with a distinct disease biology overlay induces immune dysfunction. For example, the\n      impact of aging on the human immune system is well documented. In MM it has long-since been\n      understood that there is a spectrum of immune dysregulation, an important host factor\n      considered in the \"Hallmarks of cancer\" theory. In addition, the delivery of anti-MM therapy\n      includes immune modulating agents such as steroids, proteasome inhibitors and CD38-directed\n      therapy though not all immune modulation is necessarily detrimental.\n\n      As such, myeloma patients are considered a higher risk in the current pandemic with\n      SARS-COVID19. However, it is not clear whether this is actually the case, and the risk may\n      not be different to population in general. Equally it may be sub-groups of patients who are\n      at risk e.g. on treatment versus stable response (plateau), frailty. AS such, this proposal\n      aims to collect in an observational study, the outcomes of COVID19 infection in MM patients\n      across Europe.",

    "trial_description": "Both international (WHO; (1) and national are calling for increased testing for the\n      SARS-CoV-2 virus; at present it is completely unclear how many people will actually become\n      infected with the Covid-19 virus or have formed antibodies against it during the pandemic.\n      The greatest uncertainty of all calculation models on hospitalisation rates, morbidity and\n      mortality of the pandemic is the unknown number of unreported cases of citizens infected or\n      having been infected with Covid-19.\n\n      Currently the direct detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the mouth/nose/throat swab using\n      PCR is established worldwide with high sensitivity and specificity. This direct method is\n      expensive and not always available in sufficient quantities. Furthermore, the results are\n      strongly influenced by the quality of the smear collection.\n\n      The detection of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus is an alternative method for\n      determining whether a person has been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and has developed an immune\n      response to the virus. Recently several companies have been offering such kits for sale.\n      According to national experts, these kits have not yet been sufficiently clinically\n      validated, which is why valid data on their sensitivity and specificity are not yet\n      available. However, on the validation of these tests are being worked hard all over the\n      world, so that it can be assumed (the experts also agree on this) that data on the\n      sensitivity and specificity of the antibody tests will be available in the foreseeable\n      future.\n\n      Probably the only reasonable and feasible method of testing the actual rate of Covid-19\n      infection in a given population is to detect infection (either directly or indirectly by\n      means of antibody testing) from a sample that is as representative as possible for this\n      population.\n\n      The selected subjects of the LEAD study, the core project of the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute\n      for Lung Health at Otto Wagner Hospital (the hospital association is an official partner of\n      the institute), represent an exemplary representative sample of the general population in\n      Vienna (i.e. the sample corresponds to the Viennese population in terms of age, gender,\n      smoking habits, place of residence, etc.). In the LEAD study, more than 11,000 subjects (aged\n      6-80) mainly from Vienna were subjected to a \"Health examination survey\" (2).\n\n      Due to the conditions described above, blood should be drawn from the subjects of the LEAD\n      study at two points in time (as early as possible and after two to three months) and blood\n      sera should be frozen to determine antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and tested with a test of\n      high sensitivity and specificity. According to the WHO this procedure (longitudinal cohort\n      study with serial sampling of the same individuals (in the same geographic area) each time)\n      is recommended in that provides the most comprehensive information on extent of infection.\n\n      By testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies twice in the subjects of the LEAD study (random sample),\n      an accurate and representative estimate of the actual positive Covid-19 cases in the Viennese\n      population and the rate of spread during the pandemic could be extrapolated for Vienna in the\n      foreseeable future. Since more than 1,500 individual parameters were measured in the\n      participants of the LEAD study, conclusions on socioeconomics, lifestyle factors and possible\n      risk profiles (e.g. co-morbidity, smoking behaviour, etc.) can be drawn from those who tested\n      positive (but also negative). In addition, a query regarding symptoms should be carried out\n      at both dates in order to obtain information on the percentage of asymptomatic infections\n      with SARS-CoV-2.",

Thus there is a lack of\n      sufficient data of occult immunization or persistent state on immunization.\n\n      In our study up to 400 health care personnel will be screened serologically for IgM, IgA and\n      IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Blood and urine samples throughout 12 months will be\n      sampled and analyzed.\n\n      The aim of the study is to identify the rate of occult immunization and at the same time to\n      gather data about the persistence of immune response to an infection with SARS-CoV-02.

Coagulation\n      disorders have also been reported in many patients with severe courses of Coronavirus disease\n      2019 (Covid-19). But it is difficult to assess these changes. Global coagulation tests have\n      been shown to incorrectly assess in vivo coagulation in patients admitted to intensive care\n      units. But other tests are available. Thrombin generation assay (TGA) is a laboratory test\n      which allows the assessment of an individual's potential to generate thrombin. But also in\n      conventional TGA the protein C system is hardly activated because of the absence of\n      endothelial cells (containing natural thrombomodulin) in the plasma sample. Therefore the\n      investigators add recombinant human thrombomodulin to a conventional TGA. Thereby the\n      investigators hope to be able to depict in vivo coagulation more closely than global\n      coagulation tests do.",

This visit will be used to confirm that the study inclusion\r\n      and exclusion criteria are met and serves as baseline assessment prior to randomization.\r\n\r\n      Treatment period (Day 1-15): Participants in the investigational treatment arm will receive\r\n      DFV890 orally or via a nasogastric feeding tube administered for a total of 14 days in\r\n      addition to SoC. Study drug will be supplied in tablet form which can be crushed, allowing\r\n      for both oral and nasogastric administration. Participants in the control arm will receive\r\n      SoC alone.\r\n\r\n      Participants will be randomized as soon as possible, but within a maximum of 24 hours after\r\n      screening in a 1:1 ratio to receive either DFV890 in addition to SoC or SoC alone. Study\r\n      assessments will be conducted every 2 days for hospitalized participants.\r\n\r\n      The End of Treatment (EOT) visit will take place on Day 15. If participants are discharged\r\n      from the hospital prior to Day 15, assessments on the day of discharge should be performed\r\n      according to the schedule listed under Day 15; participants will continue to take the\r\n      investigational treatment at home to complete the 14-day treatment period and the\r\n      participants should return to the site for the Day 15/EOT assessment (all other visits\r\n      between discharge and Day 15 can be omitted). If a hospital visit is not possible at Day 15,\r\n      then home nursing services may be used to support this last visit where these are available\r\n      in accordance with local guidelines and should include all possible assessments (e.g., oxygen\r\n      saturation with portable monitors).\r\n\r\n      Follow-up (Day 16-29): After completion of the 14 day- treatment period, participants will be\r\n      observed until Day 29 or discharged from hospital, whichever is sooner. Study assessments to\r\n      be conducted every 2 days for hospitalized participants.\r\n\r\n      If participants are discharged from hospital prior to Day 29, a study visit conducted by\r\n      telephone will occur on Day 29 (all other visits between discharge and Day 29 can be\r\n      omitted).\r\n\r\n      30-day safety follow-up assessment (Day 45): A follow-up visit for safety will be conducted\r\n      by telephone.",

    "trial_summary": "As a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is assumed that the number of patients\r\n      with COVID-19-related disabilities will increase significantly. Patients with mild, severe,\r\n      and critical forms of the disease show long-term sequelae in different systems (respiratory,\r\n      muscular, psychological, cognitive etc.).\r\n\r\n      Persistent dyspnea is a frequently described symptom after the acute phase of the disease.\r\n      Coupled with reduced oxygen saturation, an increased risk of developing lung fibrosis has\r\n      been observed. Specialized rehabilitation medicine (e.g. pulmonary rehabilitation) might\r\n      counteract these long-term consequences and therefore seems to be a promising approach to\r\n      treat long-term COVID-19 consequences.\r\n\r\n      Further, there is scarce evidence about COVID-19 specific rehabilitation contents. It was\r\n      suggested to use treatment regimes in analogy to patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\r\n\r\n      There is evidence that pulmonary rehabilitation improves physical performance, quality of\r\n      life and reduces anxiety and depression symptoms in patients with idiopathic pulmonary\r\n      fibrosis and other chronic respiratory diseases.\r\n\r\n      Since impairments related to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis also play an important role in\r\n      COVID-19, the aim of this study is to evaluate the short and medium-term effects of a\r\n      standardized 3-week pulmonary rehabilitation program. The results will be analyzed within the\r\n      two cohorts (mild/moderate and severe/critical COVID 19) as well as between the two cohorts\r\n      for the primary outcome. Furthermore, the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation will be\r\n      compared with a retrospective cohort of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.",

    "trial_description": "The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, COronaVIrus Disease-19 (COVID-19), was first\r\n      reported on December 31, 2019. About 20% patients, mostly elderly people, suffered from a\r\n      severe form of acute respiratory failure. COVID-19 is a new clinical entity, therefore its\r\n      understanding is largely incomplete, in particular as regards medium and long term\r\n      consequences both in the clinical and functional domain. An early integration of\r\n      rehabilitation care since the acute phase is often required to cope with the functional\r\n      sequelae of the severe respiratory syndromes, as well of cardiac and neurological\r\n      complications. However, indications, approaches, timing, amount and settings are mainly\r\n      unknown due to the lack of epidemiological data regarding the impact of COVID-19 in terms of\r\n      body function impairment and activity limitations in the short term and participation\r\n      restrictions in the medium and long-term.\r\n\r\n      The purpose of the study is to apply a prospective observational design to describe the\r\n      emerging functional impairments of subjects affected by COVID-19 in the acute phase and\r\n      monitor their course and impact on activities and participation up to 12 months of onset. The\r\n      ultimate goal is to provide a reliable framework to plan rehabilitation delivery to COVID-19\r\n      survivors in each phase and foresee health needs in the medium and long term. The secondary\r\n      objective of the study is to find predictors of functional recovery, among pre-existing and\r\n      emerging individual and contextual factors, with a special focus on the latency of\r\n      rehabilitation start after hospital admission.\r\n\r\n      The study protocol complements measures of functioning with the indicators used in the\r\n      registration form for clinical characterization cases disseminated by the World Health\r\n      Organization: in doing so, the authors aim to support the global project of providing Member\r\n      States with a standardized approach to collect clinical data.\r\n\r\n      Study objectives Primary Objective: To describe the emerging functional impairments in\r\n      patients hospitalized for SARS-COV-2 infection (COVID-19), and monitor their course and\r\n      impact on activities and participation up to 12 months of onset Secondary Objective: To\r\n      search for predictive factors of recovery, among the pre-existing and emerging individual and\r\n      context-related ones. Particular attention will be paid to the presence and latency of\r\n      rehabilitation delivery after hospital admission, describing the functional evolution of\r\n      subjects who received rehabilitation since the acute phase, compared to those who did not.\r\n\r\n      MATERIALS AND METHODS. Study Design. Prospective observational study with 12-month follow-up.\r\n      Total study duration: 18 months Population. Adults, male and female, admitted to the\r\n      University Hospital \"Ospedali Riuniti of Ancona\" (UH-ORA) from March 1st, 2020 for the\r\n      management of acute COVID-19 infection, able to provide written or oral informed consent. The\r\n      only exclusion criterion will be the lack of information concerning clinical data regarding\r\n      the management in the acute ward.\r\n\r\n      Data collection: A paper CRF and an eCRF will be implemented to record patients' data\r\n\r\n        -  Clinical, laboratory and instrumental data collected in the acute phase will be\r\n           retrieved, retrospectively, from patients' clinical records.\r\n\r\n        -  Data concerning function impairments, activity limitations and participation\r\n           restrictions will be collected through direct assessment carried out by the\r\n           rehabilitation team at the enrollment, on the first referral of the patient for\r\n           counseling (T0) and at hospital discharge (Td) (for those who will receive\r\n           rehabilitation in the acute ward), as well as at 3 , 6 and 12 months of COVID-19\r\n           diagnosis (T3, T6, T12). Patient reported outcomes will be assessed through\r\n           questionnaires and interviews, also delivered by telephone or video-consultation.\r\n\r\n      The primary endpoint is the change in the overall health status observed at enrolment (T0),\r\n      compared to the pre-COVID-19 condition, and its evolution at 3, 6 and 12 months. To this aim,\r\n      we will assess:\r\n\r\n        -  independence in activities of daily living (ADLs), by the modified Rankin scale. The\r\n           modified Rankin scale is a rapid and validated measure of global independence in ADL\r\n           with a score ranging from 0 (no disability) to 5 (bedridden). To assess changes, the\r\n           pre-COVID mod. Rankin scale score, retrospectively ascertained, will be compared to the\r\n           scores prospectively collected at enrolment and at 3, 6 and 12 months\r\n\r\n        -  walking performance, by the Walking Handicap scale (WHS). The Walking Handicap scale is\r\n           a quick and validated measure of walking performance, with a score ranging from 1\r\n           (Physiological walker: Walks for exercise only either at home or in parallel bars during\r\n           physical therapy) to 6 (Community walker: Independent in all home and community\r\n           activities. Can accept crowds and uneven terrain. Demonstrates complete independence in\r\n           shopping centers). To assess changes, the pre-COVID WHS score, retrospectively\r\n           ascertained, will be compared to the scores prospectively collected at 3, 6 and 12\r\n           months\r\n\r\n        -  health-related quality of life perception, by the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36).\r\n           SF-36 is a widespread validated scale assessing patient-reported changes in\r\n           health-related well-being perception over the last 4 weeks. SF-36 scores will be\r\n           collected at 3, 6 and 12 months.\r\n\r\n      The secondary endpoint is the identification of the predictors of functional recovery at 3, 6\r\n      and 12 months, among the pre-existing and emerging individual and context-related factors.\r\n\r\n      The following explanatory variables will be considered:\r\n\r\n        -  Pre-existing individual factors: age, gender, blood type, nutritional status,\r\n           comorbidity (Modified Cumulative Illness Rating Scale - CIRS), life habits and\r\n           pre-existing disability (modified Rankin Scale and Walking Handicap scale in pre-COVID\r\n           phase)\r\n\r\n        -  Emerging individual factors: severity of COVID-19 on admission to the acute ward,\r\n           severity of pneumonia during hospitalization (according to Li et al 2020), blood\r\n           chemistry (e.g. levels of interleukine, albumin, creatinine, CRP), pulmonary\r\n           thromboembolism, neurologic complications, swallow disorders in the acute phase;\r\n           severity of body function impairment and activity limitation on enrolment (as measured\r\n           by the Trunk control test-TCT, Standing Balance-SB, Functional Ambulation Category-FAC,\r\n           modified Barthel index- mBI, Montreal Cognitive Assessment-MoCA)\r\n\r\n        -  Emerging context-related factors: drug treatment in the acute phase (e.g. ACE\r\n           inhibitors, Angiotensin II receptor blockers, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories,\r\n           Antivirals, heparin), procedures adopted in the ICU (prone positioning, tracheostomy,\r\n           support for ventilation, ECMO, Renal replacement therapy or dialysis,\r\n           Inotropes/vasopressors), rehabilitation delivery in the acute ward and latency from\r\n           hospital admission to rehabilitation start.\r\n\r\n      Clinical-functional evaluations will be carried out at the following time-points:\r\n\r\n      T0 = on enrolment Td = discharge from the acute ward (only for subjects who are enrolled\r\n      during their stay in the acute ward) T3, T6, T12 = three, six and 12 months after hospital\r\n      admission due to COVID-19 infection.\r\n\r\n      After discharge from hospital, the assessments will be carried out in the outpatient\r\n      laboratory; in case of mobility restrictions, questionnaires will be delivered and interviews\r\n      will be conducted by telephone or by video consulting.\r\n\r\n      Sample size and data analysis. Given the nature of the study, a formal calculation of the\r\n      sample size was not made. The enrolment of at least 100 subjects is estimated based on\r\n      COVID-19 incidence in the catchment population of the UH-ORA.\r\n\r\n      A descriptive analysis will be conducted on the collected variables using point estimates and\r\n      variability measures for quantitative variables or absolute and relative frequencies for\r\n      category variables.\r\n\r\n      A multivariate model will be constructed to extrapolate predictors of poor recovery at 12\r\n      months (i.e. Delta T12-T0 on modified Rankin score : >1), by adjusting for potential\r\n      confounders. After checking for the normal distribution of quantitative measures, the\r\n      analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures will be applied to analyze the\r\n      distribution of functional outcome measures, at 3, 6 and 12 months, among those who received\r\n      rehabilitation in the acute phase, respect to those who did not.",

Data will be collected at the patients' admission, during hospital stay, at\n      discharge and 1, 3, 6, 12 months after discharge.\n\n      In particular, the following specific pieces of information will be gathered:\n\n        -  routinely collected demographic, socioeconomic, clinical, biological and diagnostic data\n\n        -  frailty condition (by using the clinical frailty scale)\n\n        -  assessment of the functional capacities through ADL and IADL tests\n\n        -  health conditions; nutritional status; medications; treatments and procedures\n\n        -  biomarkers of aging including cytokines and anti-inflammatory molecules, previously\n           identified in a focus group of experts\n\n      Results and findings will help support changes in clinical practice and decision making, with\n      the aim of reducing adverse outcomes, the worsening of health conditions in the elderly\n      population, the use of healthcare services and, as a consequence, lower healthcare\n      expenditure.",

    "trial_summary": "The current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in extraordinary public\n      health orders of social distancing and self-isolation, leading to widespread disruption and\n      discontinuation of cardiac rehabilitation programmes and other social opportunities for\n      cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients to exercise. In Austria, the government initiated\n      drastic public health measures on March 10, 2020, closing all outpatient cardiac\n      rehabilitation facilities and restricting inpatient rehabilitation to patients with urgent\n      medical indications only.\n\n      This study aims to explore the impact of COVID-19-related national lockdown and public health\n      restrictions on cardiac rehabilitation patients, with respect to maintenance of physical\n      activity for secondary CVD prevention.\n\n      The study poses three research questions, which will be addressed in a mixed-methods study\n      with sequential quantitative-qualitative (QUANT-QUAL) design:\n\n        1. What was the impact of the COVID-19-related lockdown on patients' physical activity and\n           physical fitness levels? (QUANT stage)\n\n        2. What was the patient experience of the closure of group-based cardiac rehabilitation\n           training due to COVID-19 public health restrictions? (QUAL stage)\n\n        3. Which insights and learning points may be drawn from patients' experiences during\n           COVID-19 public health restrictions with respect to the provision of home-based digital\n           support for physical activity? (QUAL stage)\n\n      The study will recruit a cohort of up to 40 cardiac rehabilitation patients from one\n      outpatient cardiac rehabilitation centre in Salzburg, Austria, whose rehabilitation programme\n      was interrupted by COVID-19 public health orders, including \"lockdown\".\n\n      Patients will undergo re-assessment of physical fitness in cycle ergometry test and\n      re-assessment of cardiovascular risk profile. This will be compared with patients' most\n      recent available test results from before the COVID-19 lockdown (i.e. prior to mid-March\n      2020) from patient records. Additionally, patients will take part in a semi-structured\n      qualitative interview in which they will be invited to reflect on their personal experiences\n      during the COVID-19 lockdown and thereafter.",

Tofacitinib, a JAK1/3-Inhibitor, could mitigate alveolar inflammation by\n      blocking IL-6 signal. The aim of this prospective single cohort open study is to test the\n      hypotesis that early administration of tofacitinib in patients with symptomatic pneumonia\n      could reduce pulmonary flogosis, preventing function deterioration and the need of mechanical\n      ventilation and/or admission in intensive care units.",
    "trial_description": "Interstitial Pneumonia is the main complication of SARS-CoV2 infection. Immune system\n      hyperactivation, leading to alveolar inflammation, is the main mechanism in determining lung\n      damage. Evidence are accumulating about the pivotal role played by IL-6 in this disease.\n      Preliminary evidence, indeed, point out the efficacy of an IL-6 receptor inhibitor in\n      improving clinical conditions in a proportion of rapidly deteriorating patients. Our\n      hypotesis is that a precocious inhibition of IL-6 signal, by the administration of\n      tofacitinib (JAK 1/3 Inhibitor), could hinder the progression to more severe grades of lung\n      inflammation leading to pulmonary function deterioration. In a prospective single cohort open\n      study, 50 patients admitted in Hospital due to SARS-CoV 2 symptomatic interstitial pneumonia,\n      but not requiring mechanical ventilation, will be enrolled. Tofacitinb will be administered\n      every day for 14 days, starting within 24 h from the admission. The primary outcome is to\n      evaluate the effect of this drug on the rate of patients who will need mechanical\n      ventilation. Safety in this population will also be actively monitored.",

The objective of this study is\n      to investigate new possibilities to reduce the number of patients requiring mechanical\n      ventilation. This is intended to address the most urgent need to preserve the access to\n      intensive care unit support to the lowest possible number of patients and may potentially\n      reduce mortality.",
    "trial_description": "This is an open label, controlled, parallel group, 3-arm, multicenter study to assess the\n      efficacy and safety of Emapalumab or Anakinra, versus standard of care (SoC). Patients\n      between 30 and 80 years will be eligible to participate in the study. The study is planned to\n      consist of three groups, each comprising 18 patients. Treatment will be randomized to either\n      Emapalumab+SoC, Anakinra+SoC or only SoC for two weeks. Follow-up visit or phone calls will\n      be made 4 and 8 weeks after end of treatment period.",

    "trial_summary": "COVID-19 DISEASE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused\n      by a newly emergent coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome from COVID-19, that was\n      first recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. While most people with COVID-19 develop\n      mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease requiring\n      hospitalization and oxygen support and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit. In\n      severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS)\n      requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation, sepsis and septic shock, multiorgan failure,\n      including acute kidney, liver and cardiac injury.\n\n      ARDS REHABILITATION Critically ill people who undergo prolonged mechanical ventilation often\n      develop weakness, with severe symmetrical weakness of and deconditioning of the proximal\n      musculature and of the respiratory muscles (critical illness neuropathy/myopathy).These\n      individuals also develop significant functional impairment and reduced health-related quality\n      of life (HRQL) up to 2 and 5 years after discharge.\n\n      ARDS survivors may complain of depression, anxiety, memory disturbances, and difficulty with\n      concentration often unchanged at 2 and 5 years. Less than half of all ARDS survivors return\n      to work within the first year following discharge, two-thirds at two years, and more than 70%\n      at five years.\n\n      Early physiotherapy (PT) of people with ARDS has recently been suggested as a complementary\n      therapeutic tool to improve early and late outcomes. The aims of PT programs should be to\n      reduce complications of immobilization and ventilator-dependency, to improve residual\n      function, to prevent new hospitalisations, and to improve health status and HRQL.\n      Physiotherapy in critical patients is claimed also to prevent and contribute to treat\n      respiratory complications such as secretion retention, atelectasis, and pneumonia. Early\n      mobilization and maintenance of muscle strength may reduce the risk of difficult weaning,\n      limited mobility, and ventilator dependency.\n\n      Lastly, pulmonary rehabilitation in ICU in mechanically ventilated subjects may reduce length\n      of stay in ICU up to 4.5 day, shorten mechanical ventilation of 2.3 days and weaning by 1.7\n      days.\n\n      The aim of this study is to investigate how early pulmonary and motor rehabilitation impacts\n      on length of hospital admission (ICU and acute ward) and early and late outcomes inpatients\n      that develop ARDS due to COVID-19.",

Two tertiary referral centers, part of\n      the same region (Veneto) but located in different cities, will recruit participants. ICU\n      standard of care is the same as defined by regional and national guidelines; rehabilitation\n      in ICU COVID-19 subjects is provided only in one center due to local technical and\n      organizational limitations. Non contamination between centers is possible due to restrictions\n      of mobility and strict admission criteria based on catchment area.\n\n      Early physiotherapy treatment will start from the day of admission. Baseline measurement of\n      physical function will performed using the Physical Function in ICU Test (PFIT). The PFIT is\n      a submaximal exercise test that was developed for patients in the ICU who may not be able to\n      mobilize away from the bedside.\n\n      Participants will start rehabilitation if they will not experiment one of the following\n      conditions or should cease exercise because of the following (see exclusion criteria).\n\n      Rehabilitation Intervention\n\n      Rehabilitation program will start at admission in ICU.

    "trial_description": "BACKGROUND:\r\n\r\n      In February, the first case of SARS-CoV2 positive patient was recorded in Lombardy (Italy), a\r\n      virus capable of causing a severe form of acute respiratory failure called Coronavirus\r\n      Disease 2019 (COVID-19).\r\n\r\n      Qualitative assessments of lung morphology have been identified to describe macroscopic\r\n      characteristics of this infection upon admission and during the hospitalization of patients.\r\n\r\n      At the moment, there are no studies that have exhaustively described the parenchymal lung\r\n      damage induced by SARS-CoV2 by quantitative analysis.\r\n\r\n      The hypothesis of this study is that specific morphological and quantitative alterations of\r\n      the lung parenchyma assessed by means of CT scan in patients suffering from severe\r\n      respiratory insufficiency induced by SARS-CoV2 may have an impact on the severity of the\r\n      degree of alteration of the respiratory exchanges (oxygenation and clearance of the CO2) and\r\n      have an impact on patient outcome.\r\n\r\n      The presence of characteristic lung morphological patterns assessed by CT scan could allow\r\n      the recognition of specific patient clusters who can benefit from intensive treatment\r\n      differently, making a significant contribution to stratifying the severity of patients and\r\n      their risk of mortality.\r\n\r\n      This is an exploratory clinical descriptive study of lung CT images in a completely new\r\n      patient population who are nucleic acid amplification test confirmed SARS-CoV2 positive.\r\n\r\n      SAMPLE SIZE (n. patients):\r\n\r\n      The study will collect all patients with the inclusion criteria; a total of 500 patients are\r\n      expected to be collected.\r\n\r\n      About 80 patients will be enrolled for each local experimental center.\r\n\r\n      The following patient data will be analyzed:\r\n\r\n        -  blood gas analytical data assigned to the CT scan, checks performed upon entering the\r\n           hospital, at the time of performing the CT scan, admission to intensive care and 7 days\r\n           after entry\r\n\r\n        -  patient characteristics such as age, gender and body mass index (BMI)\r\n\r\n        -  comorbidity\r\n\r\n        -  presence of organ dysfunction with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)\r\n\r\n        -  laboratory data relating to hospital admission and symptoms prior to hospitalization.\r\n\r\n        -  ventilator and hemodynamic parameters upon entering the hospital, at the time of\r\n           carrying out the CT scan, upon admission to intensive care and 7 days after entry.\r\n\r\n      The machine learning approach of lung CT scan analysis will aim at evaluating:\r\n\r\n        1. Quantitative and qualitative lung alterations;\r\n\r\n        2. The stratification of such morphological characteristics in specific morphological lung\r\n           clusters identified by the means of artificial intelligence using deep learning\r\n           algorithms.\r\n\r\n      ETHICAL ASPECTS:\r\n\r\n      The lung CT scan images will be collected and anonymized. Images will be subsequently sent by\r\n      University of Milano-Bicocca Institutional google drive account to the University of\r\n      Pennsylvania, Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care and the Department of Radiology\r\n      in a deidentified format for advanced quantitative analysis taking advantage of artificial\r\n      intelligence using deep learning algorithms.\r\n\r\n      The data will be collected in a pseudo-anonymous way through paper Case Report Form (CRF) and\r\n      analyzed by the scientific coordinator of the project.\r\n\r\n      Given the retrospective nature of the study and in the presence of technical difficult in\r\n      obtaining an informed consent of patients in this period of pandemic emergency, informed\r\n      consent will be waived.\r\n\r\n      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:\r\n\r\n      Continuous data will be expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation or median and interquartile\r\n      range, according to data distribution that will be evaluated by the Shapiro-Wilk test.\r\n      Categorical variables will be expressed as proportions (frequency).\r\n\r\n      The deep learning segmentation algorithm will segment the lung parenchyma from the entire CT\r\n      lung. Lung volume, lung weight and opacity intensity distribution analysis will be applied.\r\n      Second, clustering analysis to stratify the patients will be performed. Both an intensity and\r\n      a spatial clustering algorithm will be tested. Third, a model will be trained to predict the\r\n      injury progression using the images and all other patient data. Statistical significance will\r\n      be considered in the presence of a p<0.05 (two-tailed).",

More than\r\n      30 millions of recoveries worldwide were registered at the end of October 2020 with more than\r\n      1 million of deaths. As the disease continues to spread, strategies aimed to reduce\r\n      hospitalization time in sub intensive unit care, thus reducing pressure on health system, but\r\n      also to reduce some of the pathological features of COVID-19 such as inflammation and the\r\n      \"cytokines storm\".\r\n\r\n      The ketogenic diet is a high fat, low carbohydrate, adequate-protein diet that promotes a\r\n      physiological ketosis (due to an increase of liver ketone bodies production). High fat, low\r\n      carbohydrate diets have been shown to reduce duration of ventilator support and partial\r\n      pressure carbon dioxide in patients with acute respiratory failure. Moreover, the\r\n      physiological increase in plasma levels of ketone bodies exerts important anti-inflammatory\r\n      and immunomodulating effects, which may reveal as precious tools to reduce potential adverse\r\n      outcomes of COVID-19 disease.\r\n\r\n      The hypothesis of this study is that the administration of a ketogenic diet will improve gas\r\n      exchange, reduce inflammation, and the duration of hospitalization. The plan is to enrol 28\r\n      patients with diagnosis of COVID-19 hospitalized but not in ICU with SPO2 higher than 88%.",

    "trial_summary": "An increased risk of both venous and arterial thromboembolism was noted in reports from\n      SARS-CoV-2-infected patients in China and has been confirmed in autopsy findings from\n      patients who experienced sudden death. Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs), which encompass\n      polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis, are thrombophilic\n      disorders with a natural propensity to thrombosis that is fuelled by the intrinsic activation\n      of inflammatory cytokines. It therefore follows that an underlying diagnosis of MPN may\n      increase the risk of worse clinical outcomes and death during periods of active Covid-19\n      disease. This ambispective, observational study aims to elucidate the key factors which\n      affect the clinical course of patients with MPN who develop Covid-19 disease.",
    "trial_description": "This is an European multicenter observational study that will include around 80 MPN patients\n      with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19 will be followed for at least one month. Detailed\n      information on the clinical characteristics of these patients and their disease outcomes will\n      be retrospectively and prospectively collected in a specific eCRF, including MPN\n      characteristics, treatment and comorbidities pre-Covid-19, time of Covid-19 diagnosis,\n      drugs/device used for the treatment of Covid-19, any change in MPN therapy, antithrombotic\n      prophylaxis employed during the period of infection and - for hospitalised patients only -\n      key blood and laboratory parameters. A particular focus will be on exploring final outcomes\n      for patients in this study, most notably the incidence of fatal and non-fatal thrombotic\n      events. Statistical analyses will also be performed looking for any independent factors that\n      can significantly predict patient outcomes after Covid-19 diagnosis.\n\n      Ultimately, this project will provide important insights into disease severity and\n      progression in patients with MPN and Covid-19 and uncover the key clinical factors which\n      drive outcomes and mortality. Results may help clinicians better understand how patient\n      characteristics and management decisions can impact on disease trajectory when MPN and\n      Covid-19 collide.",
